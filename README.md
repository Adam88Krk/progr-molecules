# progr-molecules

Program working on the basis of input xyz file with coordinates for molecule.

At the beginning only "Load" button is active. Please uplad the file by providing the correct path.
Please follow the file coordinates.xyz when creating your file with coordinates. Please follow the format and structure - in first row you always need to have total number of atoms in molecule.
Then starting from second row you need the atom symbol and coordinates.

After upload the file, please click the active "See coordinates" button. You should see the second frame with the table on the left and buttons on the right.
Now you can provide atoms in appropriate field by typing their numbers and calculate some properties - bond length, angle and torsion. 

I would like to develop this work in the future. My plan is to have the application with the possibilty to visualize the molecule.
Thank you for reading.
